//Chapter 1 Notes//

Use urllib to perform networking/'web browser' requests.
urllib is a standard library, so does not need to be installed

BeautifulSoup is used to parse, and store XML/HTML

Information of using Virtual Libraries on P26, which allows projects to e self contained regarding external libraries.

Reading HTMl with BeautifulSoup creates an object that cascades through HTML tags, but can call tags in unexpected ways (see P27)

Need to be able to deal with website problems. Could simply have a problem connecting to the site. If page is not found, urlopne with throw HTTPError, which can be handled with an exception. If the server cannot be found, urlopen returns a None object, so check if the returned object is Null.

Before accessing a given tag in a BeautifulSoup object, should check the tag exists. If it does not, the object will be None and attempting to access the tag will throw an AttributeError. So check for both - except for the attribute error and check if the object itself is a None.
