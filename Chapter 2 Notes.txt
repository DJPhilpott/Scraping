//Chapter 2 Notes//

If HTML on site appears to be convoluted, seek out a printer friendly or mobile link as these will likely be simpler. 
If JavaScript files are on the site, inspect them for information. 
Check URL for information

CSS can also be used to scrape. Different sections and information may be distinguished using CSS due to color/font/size differences etc.

.get_text() should be the last piece of processing done as it will strip tags and make it more difficult to process further.

P38 has information on find() and findall() arguments. Class is reserved word in python, so use class_ instead.

Children are exactly one tag below a parent. Descendants are all tags at all levels below a given parent. Search for tags will run on descendants. Use the .children tag to search only children.

Siblings can be used to process through equivalent level tags
